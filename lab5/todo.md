# TODO report
- generate javadoc
- report done


# TODO competition
- gaussian noise for data augmentation
- apply convolution to the input (decrease weights)
- prepare several neural networks as a project zip
- normalize mooshak input for v2+


# TODO bugs
- printing the trainingSet has a row at full 0s? (black pixel at bottom right)
- k-folds should initialize random weights to the network each time (no need to load it from file either)


# DONE
- document all code
- k-fold cross validation
- normalize mooshak input
- make mooshak tests but locally


# DONE report
- make sure the accuracy at the start in introduction is "real" (>99%?)
- explain there's a lack of unit tests
- explain the code isn't refined
- explain momenturm term could be added for faster conversion
- plot MSE
- training metrics
- k-fold cross validation
- make an analysis of the network using random samples as training/testing and check testing values
- generate UML
- methodology
- results and discussion
- conclusion
- introduction
